/**
 * Unobtrusive scripting adapter for jQuery
 *
 * Requires jQuery 1.6.0 or later.
 * https://github.com/rails/jquery-ujs

 * Uploading file using rails.js
 * =============================
 *
 * By default, browsers do not allow files to be uploaded via AJAX. As a result, if there are any non-blank file fields
 * in the remote form, this adapter aborts the AJAX submission and allows the form to submit through standard means.
 *
 * The `ajax:aborted:file` event allows you to bind your own handler to process the form submission however you wish.
 *
 * Ex:
 *     $('form').live('ajax:aborted:file', function(event, elements){
 *       // Implement own remote file-transfer handler here for non-blank file inputs passed in `elements`.
 *       // Returning false in this handler tells rails.js to disallow standard form submission
 *       return false;
 *     });
 *
 * The `ajax:aborted:file` event is fired when a file-type input is detected with a non-blank value.
 *
 * Third-party tools can use this hook to detect when an AJAX file upload is attempted, and then use
 * techniques like the iframe method to upload the file instead.
 *
 * Required fields in rails.js
 * ===========================
 *
 * If any blank required inputs (required="required") are detected in the remote form, the whole form submission
 * is canceled. Note that this is unlike file inputs, which still allow standard (non-AJAX) form submission.
 *
 * The `ajax:aborted:required` event allows you to bind your own handler to inform the user of blank required inputs.
 *
 * !! Note that Opera does not fire the form's submit event if there are blank required inputs, so this event may never
 *    get fired in Opera. This event is what causes other browsers to exhibit the same submit-aborting behavior.
 *
 * Ex:
 *     $('form').live('ajax:aborted:required', function(event, elements){
 *       // Returning false in this handler tells rails.js to submit the form anyway.
 *       // The blank required inputs are passed to this function in `elements`.
 *       return ! confirm("Would you like to submit the form with missing info?");
 *     });
